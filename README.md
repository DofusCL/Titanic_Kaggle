Construir un modelo para descubrir qué tipo de pasajero es más propenso a "Morir"
Se construirá en dos archivos, uno de entrenamiento y un dataset con predicciones (que es el que debemos enviar).

(1) train.csv
train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers, to be exact -- where each passenger gets a different row in the table). To investigate this data, click on the name of the file on the left of the screen. Once you've done this, you can view all of the data in the window.

(2) test.csv
Using the patterns you find in train.csv, you have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (in test.csv) survived.

3) gender_submission.csv
The gender_submission.csv file is provided as an example that shows how you should structure your predictions. It predicts that all female passengers survived, and all male passengers died. Your hypotheses regarding survival will probably be different, which will lead to a different submission file. But, just like this file, your submission should have:

a "PassengerId" column containing the IDs of each passenger from test.csv.
a "Survived" column (that you will create!) with a "1" for the rows where you think the passenger survived, and a "0" where you predict that the passenger died.
